# Tortoise Edition 🐢

Welcome to your winter arc of becoming a full-stack web developer.

This is the Tortoise Edition: slow, steady and consistent.

Each day gives you a simple mix of watching, coding and building, helping you stay accountable and build the habit of shipping code daily.

By the end, you’ll feel confident enough to create real responsive layouts from scratch and be ready for the next phase of your full-stack journey.

---

## Motivation

Don’t rush. The goal isn’t speed, it’s depth.

Each day builds on the last. By Day 27, you won’t just “know HTML, CSS, Tailwind” you’ll **think like a developer** who can turn any idea into a working web page.
