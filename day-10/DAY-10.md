## Topic - 01: The current state of CSS

- Code Files

  - **[The current state of CSS](./Topic-01_Current-State-of-CSS/index.html)**

**Introduction**

- CSS is an Art itself.

- CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**.

- CSS has two parts:

  1. Learning the foundation

  2. Making website beautiful(the more you know the foundation, easier it is to make beautiful websites).

- It describes the visual styling and representation of the content written in HTML.

- It consists of countless properties that developer uses to format the content (text, images, links etc)

**The Current State of CSS:**

Modern CSS is powerful and evolving rapidly. Today, CSS supports:

**Layout Systems:**

- **Flexbox & Grid** - Layout systems that replaced float-based layouts

- **Subgrid** - Nested grids that align with parent grid

**Dynamic Styling:**

- **CSS Variables (Custom Properties)** - Reusable values: `--main-color: #3b82f6;`

- **Container Queries** - Style elements based on their parent's size, not just viewport

- **Cascade Layers (@layer)** - Better control over specificity and style organization

**Responsive Design:**

- **Media Queries** - Device-specific styling

- **Modern sizing functions** - `clamp()`, `min()`, `max()`

**Advanced Selectors:**

- **:has() Selector** - The "parent selector" developers always wanted.

- **CSS Nesting** - Write nested selectors natively (not just in preprocessors!)

**Visual Effects:**

- **Animations & Transitions** - Smooth, performant animations

- **View Transitions API** - Seamless page state changes

- **Scroll-driven Animations** - Animations triggered by scroll position

**Color & Design:**

- **New Color Spaces** - `oklch()`, `color-mix()`, wider gamut colors

**Nowadays, you can write CSS using utility-based frameworks and component libraries such as:**

**Utility-First Frameworks:**

- Tailwind CSS

- Bootstrap

**Component Libraries:**

- shadcn/ui

- Chakra UI

- Ant Design

- Daisy UI

**CSS Frameworks:**

- Materialize

- Flowbite

**UI Component Collections:**

- Magic UI

- Aceternity UI

- And many more...

- CSS has become more developer-friendly with better browser support and reduced dependency on external layout hacks (like floats and tables).

## Topic - 02: You can write css at 3 places

- Code Files

  - **[Inline CSS](./Topic-02_Ways-to-Write-CSS/01-inline-css/inline-css-example.html)**

  - **[Internal CSS](./Topic-02_Ways-to-Write-CSS/02-internal-css/internal-css-example.html)**
